**INFOINST 8620: Database and Analytics**

**Synopsis**

Covers the Fundamental concepts of current database systems and query methods with emphasis on relational model and non-relational techniques in Big Data environments. Topics include entity-relationship model, relational algebra, indexing, query optimization, normal forms, tuning, security, NoSQL, and data analytics skills in both relational and non-relational environments. Project work involves modern relational DBMS systems and NoSQL environments.

**Course Prerequisites**

 - Basic understanding of mathematical principles of vectors and matrices
 - Basic course in probability and statistics

**Topics**

- NOSQL Database Design and Implementation
- Big Data: Hive, HBase, Spark
- Working with Spatial Data
- Temporal Data analysis and managing time series data
- Graph Databases and social graphs

**Course outcomes**

Students will develop the ability to assess information needs in a business context and design a database solution using relational or NOSQL databases, as appropriate
Students will understand the theoretical foundations of database management systems applied to large scale computing environments, including particular challenges of performance and support.

Students will understand strategies for working with spatial data, including geospatial data.
Students will be able to analyze social graph data from Facebook and other graph based systems using Neo4J and other graph database engines.

Students will be able to apply programming languages from prior courses and experience to transform, reshape and load data sources into a schema they design
students will be able to construct basic analytical and visualization programs using appropriate tools and techniques as they work with large scale (big) data.

**Potential Data Sets for Learning Modules**

 - Twitter events database
 - Facebook events database
 - Cell phone databases


**Workload**

Students will have individual skills development exercises in conjunction with each unit of the course
Units 1 5 are worth 10% each of the course grade.
Units 6 and 7 are worth 15% each of the course grade.
Unit 8 will include a final course project worth 20% of the course grade.


**Course Participation Policy**

 - Lecture and Problems-based Learning
 - Lecture discussions, along with homework assignments, are the core delivery mechanism for the course material.  
 - Throughout the semester, lecture topics will often be interlaced with discussions relevant to on-going homework assignments.
 The primary method in which students learn mastery of the course topics is by executing the sequence of:
  - a) studying the techniques presented during lectures,
  - b) implementing technological solutions to problems using the learned techniques and
  - c) analyzing their solutions.  

The course material and homework sequences are designed to build upon each other; providing the student with a complete understanding of the various technologies and techniques to apply data science and analytical methods.

Each lecture and problem set builds upon the concepts and lessons of the previous material, and therefore they are each critical to the progression of the class. Each homework will be discussed throughout its assignment period, then in significant recap after its due date. For this reason, no late homework submissions will be accepted. All homework is an individual effort, collaborative implementation or copying will result in a zero (0) on the assignment for all students involved.
