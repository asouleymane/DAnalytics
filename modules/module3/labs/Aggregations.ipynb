    "1. COUNT()\n",
    "    1. This function will allow you to count the number of results from a query\n",
    "    1. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_count_function.htm - This is a good explanation of how COUNT works.\n",
    "1. MIN()\n",
    "    1. This function will return the minimum value of a column in the database\n",
    "    1. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_min_function.htm - This is a good explination of how MIN works\n",
    "1. MAX()\n",
    "    1. This function will return the maximum value of a column in the database\n",
    "    1. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_max_function.htm - This is a good explination of how MAX works\n",
    "1. AVG()\n",
    "    1. This Function will return the average value of a column of the database\n",
    "    1. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_avg_function.htm - This is a good explination of how AVG works\n",
    "1. SUM()\n",
    "    1. This functions will add the values of a  column of a database together and return the sum\n",
    "    1. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_sum_function.htm - This is a good explination of how SUM works\n",
    "1. Having Clause\n",
    "    1. This will allow the user to limit results based on the column having a value that is <, > , = a aggregate functions results.\n",
    "    1. http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp - The syntax for the Having Clause\n",
    "1. Group By Clause\n",
    "    1. This will allow the user to group together rows of the database based on having one column that is the same throughout the group\n",
