    "# Module 2 - Lab 2 - Building a Recommendation Engine in Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will build a recommendation model in Spark. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind recommendation engines is to predict what people might like and to uncover relationships between items to aid in the discovery process. They are similar to search engines. However, unlike search engines they try to present individuals with relevant content that they did not necessarily search for or that they might not have heard of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a recommendation engine tries to model the connections between users and some type of item. They are most effective in two general scenarios:\n",
    "* Large number of available options for users: When there is a very large number of available items, it becomes increasingly difficult for the user to find something they want. \n",
    "* A significant degree of personal taste involved: When personal taste plays a large role in selection, recommendation models, which often utilize a wisdom of the crowd approach, can be helpful in discovering items based on the behavior of others that have similar taste profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon's shopping cart recommendations are a good example. So are Netflix movie recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of recommendation models. The two that are most prevalent are: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Content-based filtering attemps to use the content or attributes of an item, together with some notion of similarity between two pieces of content to generate items similar to a given item. Collaborative filtering is a form of wisdom of the crowd approach where the set of preferences of users for items with which they have not yet interacted. The underlying idea is the notion of similarity. \n",

The higher the value of lambda, the more the regularization is applied. What constitutes a sensible value is very dependent on the size, nature, and sparsity of the underlying data, and as with almost all machine learning models, the regularization parameter is somthing that should be tuned using out-of-sample test data and cross-validation approaches.\n",
